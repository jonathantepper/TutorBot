Sample Text 2: Grade 12 English – Introduction to Literary Theory

The Power of Perspective: Deconstruction and Post-Structuralism

In Grade 12 English, we move beyond what a text says to ask: how does it work, and whose story is really being told? This shift is thanks to Literary Theory, which provides frameworks for deeper analysis. One of the most fascinating (and sometimes challenging) theories is Post-Structuralism, and specifically, Deconstruction.

Structuralism vs. Post-Structuralism:

Structuralism (The Foundation): Believed that meaning is created through stable, universal structures or systems (like language itself). It sought to find definitive meaning.

Post-Structuralism (The Critique): Argued that these structures are unstable and contradictory. Meaning is constantly shifting, often challenging the supposed authority of the author or the text itself.

Deconstruction (Jacques Derrida):

This critical approach, developed by philosopher Jacques Derrida, argues that all texts are inherently contradictory and their true meaning is impossible to determine.

Core Concept - Binary Oppositions: Deconstruction focuses on identifying and inverting the binary oppositions within a text (e.g., good/evil, male/female, light/dark). In traditional Western thought, one term is always "privileged" (seen as superior). Deconstruction shows how the text itself subtly relies on, or even elevates, the "unprivileged" term, destabilizing the whole meaning.

Core Concept - Differance (Derrida's word): A blend of "difference" and "deferral." It means that the meaning of a word is not found in the word itself, but only through its difference from other words, and this meaning is constantly deferred (never fully present or fixed).

Application in English Studies:

A deconstructionist reading of a classic novel doesn't try to find the "theme." Instead, it looks at the moments where the characters, plot, or narrative voice contradict the stated theme.

Example: If a story's narrator claims to support "peace and order," a deconstructionist would examine how the text uses violence and chaos to create its structure, showing the text's dependence on what it supposedly rejects. The reading uncovers the hidden assumptions and gaps in the text, showing that language (and therefore the text) is never truly a stable source of truth.
