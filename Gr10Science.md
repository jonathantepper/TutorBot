Unpacking the Recipe of Change

Have you ever baked cookies? When you mix flour, sugar, eggs, and butter and put them in the oven, you don't just get a pile of warm ingredients back, right? You get something completely new—a cookie! That's essentially what happens in a chemical reaction. It's a process where one or more substances (the reactants) are converted into different new substances (the products).

Understanding chemical change is crucial in Grade 10 Science, and it all starts with some key definitions:

Reactants and Products:

Reactants: These are the starting materials in a chemical reaction. They are written on the left side of the chemical equation. Think of them as your ingredients (flour, sugar).

Products: These are the new substances that are formed after the reaction takes place. They are written on the right side of the chemical equation (the cookie!).

The Law of Conservation of Mass (A Big Deal!):

This is one of the most fundamental concepts. It states that in any closed system, mass is neither created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction. The total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products. If you start with 100 grams of ingredients, you must end up with 100 grams of products (even if some of it is now gas!). This is why we balance chemical equations.

Four Main Types of Reactions:

Synthesis (or Combination): Two or more simple reactants combine to form a single, more complex product. (A + B $\rightarrow$ AB)

Decomposition: A single complex reactant breaks down into two or more simpler products. (AB $\rightarrow$ A + B)

Single Displacement (or Replacement): One element replaces another element in a compound. (A + BC $\rightarrow$ AC + B)

Double Displacement (or Replacement): The ions of two different compounds swap places, often resulting in a precipitate, gas, or water. (AB + CD $\rightarrow$ AD + CB)

Exothermic vs. Endothermic:

Exothermic: Reactions that release energy (usually as heat or light) into the surroundings. (e.g., burning a candle).

Endothermic: Reactions that absorb energy from the surroundings, often feeling cold to the touch. (e.g., instant cold packs).
